Description: Fantasy Portolio is a game much like Fantasy Football whereby players choose a company or friend bracket, make a portfolio for themselves, and add stocks that are updated in realtime. The more the stock gains in value the more points a player recieves. Check back after make the portfolio in subsequent days to see the stocks grow!
